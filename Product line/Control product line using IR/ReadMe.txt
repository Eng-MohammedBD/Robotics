Circuit to detect the size of carton for product line using Infrared Obstacle Avoidance module

Used 3 of this sensor to detect the size of the carton, depend on that the servo motor will classification it to small, medium, and large carton, where each one will be at the high as the carton is.

In the project:
ir1 = to detect small cartons and the servo motor will rotate to an angle of 45 degrees.
ir2 = to detect Medium cartons and the servo motor will rotate to an angle of 90 degrees.
ir3 = to detect large cartons and the servo motor will rotate to an angle of 135 degrees.

there is LED for each sensor to know which class pass know. 
in case no signal comes from sensors the servo motor will rotate to an angle of 0 degrees.
