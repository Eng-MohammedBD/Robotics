Circuit to detect the size of carton for product line using Ultrasonic sensor

Use one ultrasonic sensor to classification the carton to large, medium, and small according to that, the servo motor will control it.

the sensor will be at the top of the line, the range of program 300-0 cm, where:
- 300 to 200cm  for small cartons and the servo motor will rotate to an angle of 135 degrees.
- 199 to 100cm to medium cartons and the servo motor will rotate to an angle of 90 degrees.
- 99 to 0cm for large cartons and the servo motor will rotate to an angle of 45 degrees.
where the sensor is on the top which means when its reading distance higher the size of the carton smaller.
